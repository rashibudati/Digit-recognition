# Digit-recognition
Built a deep net model to recognize multiple digits
# Requirement to run the code in this project.
- Python 3.7
- Keras 2.30 and Tensorflow 1.14
The code will itself download the MNIST dataset and the model will be trained on the same. 
We later deployed our model into an Android Application (refer: [a link](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/branch/other_file.md)
